### Points of discussion

* In the late twentieth century, pan-Asianism may have been revived in the cloak of so-called 'Asian values'. Do you believe this comparison is warranted? If yes, discuss; if no, discuss.
* To what degree do you think pan-Asianism was mainstream rather than a fringe movement?
